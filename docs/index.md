# Poll Bot Frequently Asked Questions
## Why is Poll Bot not responding to me?
This is most likely because Poll Bot does not have the correct permissions in the channel you are trying to use it in. Poll Bot requires: __Read Messages, Send Messages, Add Reactions, Embed Links, and Read Message History__. 

Even if Poll Bot has a roll that enables all of this, channel or category specific permissions might override the role permissions, so make sure the channel and category permissions also give Poll Bot these permissions.

If you have double checked that Poll Bot has all of these permissions in the __role, category, and channel__, and Poll Bot is still not responding, check to see if it is offline. If you go to Poll Bot's profile and it doesn't have a green dot (as shown in the picture below), it is offline. Please join the [Poll Bot support server](https://discord.gg/FhT6nUn) and ping @finn#1327.
